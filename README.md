# The Core of Onion Architecture
This is a sample of .NET 6 implemented with Onion Architecture. This is how to get started with the core of the onion architecture. We start with a clean class library, unit tests, and a build. It's important to get this foundation correct before proceeding. We want our build working before adding any domain model or interfaces.
